# tldr: We distributed a version of vscode with required extnsions and tools (jdk, gradle, dotnet, mingw, python). We then went through the 4 languages 1 by 1 to get vscode to support building and debuging code and unit tests. We then coded the question in TA session. Students were expected to finish coding the same question in all 4 languges. Finally, we explained how to create build pipelines to have the project build on azure devops.
